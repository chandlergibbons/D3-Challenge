# Data Journalism and D3

![](D3.gif)

Summary: For my D3 project I sifted through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error." I was able to uitilze HTML/CSS, Javascript, the D3.js library to build out the visualizations for the data set, and python -m http.server to run the visualization.
